90 Cards

4 piles are created:
main pile: 87 cards
pile 1: 1 card
pile 2: 1 card
pile 3: 1 card

Player A looks at pile 1 secretly and chooses whether or not to draft it and add it to their pool replacing it with a card from the top of the main pile.
If they pass, they add another card from the main pile to pile 1 without looking at it and may then view pile 2 and repeat the above.
If player A chooses to pass pile 3, they take one card from the top of the main pile at random instead.

Players take turn looking at piles and choosing to either pass or draft that pile.
